However, the company has shifted in recent years to offer users a one-stop shop for all their media needs by combining access to free streaming TV and movies, plusmovie rentals, and a variety of discovery tools that help users find things they want to watch across a fragmented streaming landscape.\n","\n","In terms of the Plex mobile app’s redesign, the focus is on adding richer media, including title artwork for movies and shows — a long-requested feature. Other areas that are being tweaked include movie and show detail pages, cast and crew profiles, and personal user profile pages.\n","\n","Meanwhile, Plex’s core user base of personal home media pros can personalize their experience by favoriting certain media libraries, which now also have their own specific tab.\n","\n","One feature that helps with discovery is Plex’s universalWatchlist, where you can save items you want to watch from across your streaming services or Plex’s free streaming offerings. This feature has now been given its own spot in the app’s top-level navigation menu, as it has become one of the app’s more popular features.\n","\n","Smaller changes with this release entail reorganizing other features, like the user menu, where you can update and manage your information, like your friends list, selection of streaming services, and watch history.\n","\n","After the version of this update for TV platforms rolls out, Plex says it will focus on adding a few more improvements and bringing its TV and mobile apps to parity.\n","\n","Topics\n","\n","© 2025 Yahoo.\n"]}],"source":["import requests\n","from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n","\n","# TechCrunch article URL\n","url = \"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/31/streaming-service-plex-rolls-out-a-revamped-mobile-app/\"\n","\n","headers = {\n","    \"User-Agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)\"\n","}\n","\n","response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n","soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, \"html.parser\")\n","\n","# Extract all paragraphs with the class wp-block-paragraph\n","paragraphs = soup.find_all(\"p\", class_=\"wp-block-paragraph\")\n","article_text = \"\\n\\n\".join([p.get_text(strip=True) for p in paragraphs])\n","\n","if article_text:\n","    print(\"✅ Extracted article text:\\n\")\n","    print(article_text)\n","else:\n","    print(\"⚠️ Article content not found.
